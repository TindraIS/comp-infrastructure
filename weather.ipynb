By logging errors, details about the error can be captured, such as the command that failed, the error message, and any relevant context -- information that can then be used to diagnose and fix the issue. Additionally, [severity levels were included in each log](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/log-levels-explained/) to categorise entries based on their impact or urgency.\n",

    "    **3.2 Email notification**\n",

    "    The [email notification](https://mailtrap.io/blog/python-send-html-email/) is contained within a function that runs the `send_error_email.py` program, which is triggered everytime an error occurs. This Python script uses the native`smtp` (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and `email` modules that when combined provide the fundamental foundation for sending HTML emails directly from Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "    [The MIMEText (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.mime.html) has also been added so that HTML and CSS can be combined with plain text. Specifically, it is used to construct a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) email message which ensures the email body is encoded as plain text and includes the necessary headers for proper delivery.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - An App Password was created using my personal Google Account\n",
    "    - A .env file was created to securely store sensitive information using `nano .env`. This file was created so that the script can be mannually triggered, however it will be deleted once the workflow automation is in place. For that purpose, the sensitive variables were also added as environment variables into the GitHub Actions workflow for the project automation.\n",

This command is used to [change the permissions of files and directories in linux](https://www.howtogeek.com/437958/how-to-use-the-chmod-command-on-linux/). As for the +x , it makes the file executable for all users, enabling us ou to run it as a script.\n",
